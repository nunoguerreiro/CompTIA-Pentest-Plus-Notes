# What is Penetration Testing?
Penetration testing, also called pen testing, is a cyberattack simulation launched on computer system. Penetration tests are authorized, legal attempts to defeat an organization’s security controls and perform unauthorized activities. The tests are timeconsuming and require staff who are as skilled and determined as the real-world attackers who will attempt to compromise the organization. 

## Cybersecurity Goals
The CIA triad includes the three main charateristics of information that cybersecurity programs need to protect:
* **Confidentiality** measures seek to prevent unauthorized access to information or systems.
* **Integrity** measures seek to prevent unauthorized modification of information or systems.
* **Availability** measures seek to ensure that legitimate use of information and systems
remains possible.

The attackers’ goals, and therefore pentester’s goal, are known as the DAD triad:
* **Disclosure** attacks seek to gain unauthorized access to information or systems.
* **Alteration** attacks seek to make unauthorized changes to information or systems.
* **Denial** attacks seek to prevent legitimate use of information and systems.

## Adopting the Hacker Mind-set
Penetration tests have a focused mandate. Instead of adopting the approach of a security professional, you adopt the mind-set of an attacker. You don’t need to evaluate the effectiveness of each security control. You simply need to find either one flaw in the existing controls.
